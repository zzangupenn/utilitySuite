## ⚙️ Available Tools

| Name             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `utilitySuite`   | Root package entry — supports lazy loading so only the tools you import get loaded. Clean, efficient, and namespace-friendly. |
| `ConfigYAML`     | Simplifies reading and writing YAML configuration files. Offers intuitive dot-access, saves and loads directly to YAML files, and supports nested structures, making experiment setup and configuration management clean and scriptable. |
| `ListDict`       | A hybrid structure combining list ordering, dictionary style initialization, and dataclass access. Useful recording data with many categories. Support simple save/load. |
| `keyMonitor`     | Captures keypress events in real time without blocking the program flow. Ideal for interactive command-line tools or live-control systems. |
| `coloredText`    | Adds styled ANSI colors to terminal output. Great for improving readability in logs, CLI feedback, or debugging messages. |
| `Logger`         | A minimal, file-saving logger with optional color output and timestamping. Let you track events or experiment states without setting up complex logging frameworks. |
| `Timer`          | Simple stopwatch and context-based timing. Perfect for profiling function runtimes, monitoring loop durations, or annotating performance bottlenecks. |
| `DataProcessor`  | Contains helpers for filtering, structuring, and transforming datasets. Useful for preprocessing logs, lists, or config-driven data. |
| `colorPalette`   | A curated set of visually balanced color themes for plots and visual output. Enables consistent aesthetics across matplotlib or CLI tools. |
| `pltUtils`       | Quick-plot functions built on matplotlib — for fast rendering of line plots, histograms, and comparisons with minimal code. Great for debugging or summarizing data visually. |
